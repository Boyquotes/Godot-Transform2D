# `Transform2D` public interface specification

The purpose of this project is to **fully** specify the public interface
for <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/math/transform_2d.h">Godot's `Transform2D` class</a>.

The idea is to have one page (directory) for each proposal, and also, a page or directory listing "issues" and "use cases". Each proposal must address each listed issue and use case, one by one, in a separate section.


## List of issues / use cases

Check the [issues and use cases every proposal should address](issues/).


## List of specs

This is the list of proposed specs:
