# Godot's `Transform2D` public interface proposals

Each proposal needs to be **very precise**
on exactly how `Transform2D` should look from the **user's point of view**.
It is like if we **start by writing the documentation**, but taking **extra care** to be **very very very precise**.

1. An overview of what `Transform2D` represents and how it should behave or be used.
2. Exactly what **public** methods `Transform2D` should have.
3. Exactly what is the behaviour of each **public** method.
4. Examples for each **public** method showing **how and when** it should be used. And, optionally, how it should not be used.
5. List of compatibility issues.
